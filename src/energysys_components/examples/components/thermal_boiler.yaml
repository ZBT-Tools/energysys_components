# Energy Carrier Definitions
E_in_mc_type: NH3
E_in_sd1_type: NH3
E_in_sd2_type: Electr
E_out_type: Loss  # inhere arbitrary as E_out is 100% "Loss"

# Startup
t_start: 1  # Time until system is available [Minutes] ("idle")
E_in_start: 1  # Preparation Energy [kWh] (from cold to idle)
eta_start: 0.5  #
# Load Operation
P_out_min_rel: .10  # Minimum operating load [% Load]
P_out_rated: 2000  # Rated Load [kW]

p_change_pos: 100  # [% output load/min]

# Overall component efficiency
# Note: For Heat Generation Boiler
eta: [[.15, 1.00], [.85, .85]]  # load dependent efficiency  [[load [%]],[efficiency [%]]]
# Main conversion path efficiency

# Shutdown
t_cooldown: 1  # Time until system cooled down [Minutes] ("idle to cool")

# Secondary energy ratios
# 1: input flow, 2: electric
